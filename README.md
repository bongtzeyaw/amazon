# amazon
A Javascript project that imitates Amazon website design and functionalities. We can add products to our shopping cart and visualize each product's quantity, delivery time and price. When choosing a product, we can also choose different delivery options which will be priced differently. On the checkout page, the total price will be calculated and shown ; if we delete or add product on the same page, the price will be changed interactively as well.

Since this is a Javascript project, the main technique used to make the page interactive, is using DOM to regenerate HTML when needed. Or in other words, the MVC (Model-View-Controller) approach. In an ulterior project, we use React or other technology to evade this approach. We also use the ESM version of DayJS to work with dates more conveniently.
